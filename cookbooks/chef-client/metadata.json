The default settings in this cookbook do not require its use.\n\nCron is a dependency, for default behavior of the `cron` recipe to work. This is a dependency because `cron` is cross platform, and doesn't carry additional dependencies, unlike the other cookbooks listed above.\n\n- cron 2.0+\n- logrotate 1.9.0+\n- windows 2.0+\n\nSee [USAGE](#usage).\n\n## Attributes\n\nThe following attributes affect the behavior of the chef-client program when running as a service through one of the service recipes, or in cron with the cron recipe, or are used in the recipes for various settings that require flexibility.\n\n- `node['chef_client']['interval']` - Sets `Chef::Config[:interval]` via command-line option for number of seconds between chef-client daemon runs. Default 1800.\n- `node['chef_client']['splay']` - Sets `Chef::Config[:splay]` via command-line option for a random amount of seconds to add to interval. Default 300.\n- `node['chef_client']['log_dir']` - Sets directory used to store chef-client logs. Default \"/var/log/chef\".\n- `node['chef_client']['log_rotation']['options']` - Set options to logrotation of chef-client log file. Default `['compress']`.\n- `node['chef_client']['log_rotation']['prerotate']` - Set prerotate action for chef-client logrotation. Default to `nil`.\n- `node['chef_client']['log_rotation']['postrotate']` - Set postrotate action for chef-client logrotation. Default to chef-client service reload depending on init system.\n- `node['chef_client']['conf_dir']` - Sets directory used via command-line option to a location where chef-client search for the client config file . Default \"/etc/chef\".\n- `node['chef_client']['bin']` - Sets the full path to the `chef-client` binary. Mainly used to set a specific path if multiple versions of chef-client exist on a system or the bin has been installed in a non-sane path. Default \"/usr/bin/chef-client\".\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['minute']` - The minute that chef-client will run as a cron task. See [cron recipe](#cron)\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['hour']` - The hour that chef-client will run as a cron task. See [cron recipe](#cron)\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['weekday']` - The weekday that chef-client will run as a cron task. See [cron recipe](#cron)\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['environment_variables']` - Environment variables to pass to chef-client's execution (e.g. `SSL_CERT_FILE=/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` chef-client)\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['log_file']` - Location to capture the log output of chef-client during the chef run.\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['append_log']` - Whether to append to the log. Default: `false` chef-client output.\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['use_cron_d']` - If true, use the [`cron_d` resource](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/cron). If false (default), use the cron resource built-in to Chef.\n- `node['chef_client']['cron']['mailto']` - If set, `MAILTO` env variable is set for cron definition\n- `node['chef_client']['reload_config']` - If true, reload Chef config of current Chef run when `client.rb` template changes (defaults to true)\n- `node['chef_client']['daemon_options']` - An array of additional options to pass to the chef-client service, empty by default, and must be an array if specified.\n- `node['chef_client']['systemd']['timer']` - If true, uses systemd timer to run chef frequently instead of chef-client daemon mode (defaults to false). This only works on platforms where systemd is installed and used.\n- `node['chef_client']['systemd']['restart']` - The string to use for systemd `Restart=` value when not running as a timer. Defaults to `always`. Other possible options: `no, on-success, on-failure, on-abnormal, on-watchdog, on-abort`.\n- `node['chef_client']['task']['frequency']` - Frequency with which to run the `chef-client` scheduled task (e.g., `'hourly'`, `'daily'`, etc.) Default is `'minute'`.\n- `node['chef_client']['task']['frequency_modifier']` - Numeric value to go with the scheduled task frequency. Default is `node['chef_client']['interval'].to_i / 60`\n- `node['chef_client']['task']['start_time']` - The start time for the task in `HH:mm` format. If the `frequency` is `minute` default start time will be `Time.now` plus the `frequency_modifier` number of minutes.\n- `node['chef_client']['task']['user']` - The user the scheduled task will run as, defaults to `'SYSTEM'`.\n- `node['chef_client']['task']['password']` - The password for the user the scheduled task will run as, defaults to `nil` because the default user, `'SYSTEM'`, does not need a password.\n\nThe following attributes are set on a per-platform basis, see the `attributes/default.rb` file for default values.\n\n- `node['chef_client']['init_style']` - Sets up the client service based on the style of init system to use. Default is based on platform and falls back to `'none'`. See [service recipes](#service-recipes).\n- `node['chef_client']['run_path']` - Directory location where chef-client should write the PID file. Default based on platform, falls back to \"/var/run\".\n- `node['chef_client']['cache_path']` - Directory location for\n- `Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]` where chef-client will cache various files. Default is based on platform, falls back to \"/var/chef/cache\".\n- `node['chef_client']['backup_path']` - Directory location for `Chef::Config[:file_backup_path]` where chef-client will backup templates and cookbook files. Default is based on platform, falls back to \"/var/chef/backup\".\n- `node['chef_client']['launchd_mode']` - (Only for Mac OS X) if set to `'daemon'`, runs chef-client with `-d` and `-s` options; defaults to `'interval'`.\n- When `chef_client['log_file']` is set and running on a [logrotate](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/logrotate) supported platform (debian, rhel, fedora family), use the following attributes to tune log rotation.\n\n  - `node['chef_client']['logrotate']['rotate']` - Number of rotated logs to keep on disk, default 12.\n  - `node['chef_client']['logrotate']['frequency']` - How often to rotate chef client logs, default weekly.\n\nThis cookbook makes use of attribute-driven configuration with this attribute. See [USAGE](#usage) for examples.\n\n- `node['chef_client']['config']` - A hash of Chef::Config keys and their values, rendered dynamically in `/etc/chef/client.rb`.\n- `node['chef_client']['load_gems']` - Hash of gems to load into chef via the client.rb file\n- `node['ohai']['disabled_plugins']` - An array of ohai plugins to disable, empty by default, and must be an array if specified. Ohai 6 plugins should be specified as a string (ie. \"dmi\"). Ohai 7+ plugins should be specified as a symbol within quotation marks (ie. \":Passwd\").\n- `node['ohai']['plugin_path']` - An additional path to load Ohai plugins from. Necessary if you use the ohai_plugin resource in the Ohai cookbook to install your own ohai plugins.\n\n### Chef Client Config\n\nThe following attributes should be set using `['chef_client']['config']`. Setting them at the `['chef_client']` attribute level is **deprecated**.\n\n- `node['chef_client']['environment']` - Set the node's environment directly (useful for unattended installs when `knife bootstrap -E` is not an option).\n- `node['chef_client']['log_level']` - Not set anymore, use the default log level and output formatting in Chef 11+.\n- `node['chef_client']['server_url']` - Set by default with\n- `node['chef_client']['config']['chef_server_url']`\n- `node['chef_client']['validation_client_name']` - Set by default with `node['chef_client']['config']['validation_client_name']`.\n- `node['chef_client']['report_handlers']` - See [USAGE](#usage) for how to set handlers with the `config` attribute.\n- `node['chef_client']['exception_handlers']` - See [USAGE](#usage) for how to set handlers with the `config` attribute.\n- `node['chef_client']['checksum_cache_path']` - Use\n- `node['chef_client']['config']['cache_options']['path']`.\n- `node['chef_client']['verbose_logging']` - Not set anymore, we recommend using the default log level and output formatting in Chef 11+. This can still be set using `node['chef_client']['config']['verbose_logging']` if required.\n\n## Recipes\n\nThis section describes the recipes in the cookbook and how to use them in your environment.\n\n### config\n\nSets up the `/etc/chef/client.rb` config file from a template and reloads the configuration for the current chef-client run.\n\nSee [USAGE](#usage) for more information on how the configuration is rendered with attributes.\n\n### service recipes\n\nThe `chef-client::service` recipe includes one of the `chef-client::INIT_STYLE_service` recipes based on the attribute, `node['chef_client']['init_style']`. The individual service recipes can be included directly, too. For example, to use the init scripts, on a node or role's run list:\n\n```\nrecipe[chef-client::init_service]\n```\n\nTo set up the chef-client under runit, the runit cookbook must be specified on the node or role's run list first, to ensure that the dependencies are resolved, as this cookbook does not directly depend on runit. For example:\n\n```\nrecipe[runit]\nrecipe[chef-client::runit_service]\n```\n\nUse this recipe on systems that should have a `chef-client` daemon running, such as when Knife bootstrap was used to install Chef on a new system.\n\n- `init` - uses the init script included in this cookbook, supported on debian and redhat family distributions.\n- `upstart` - uses the upstart job included in this cookbook, supported on ubuntu.\n- `runit` - sets up the service under runit, supported on ubuntu, debian, redhat family distributions, and gentoo.\n- `launchd` - sets up the service under launchd, supported on Mac OS X & Mac OS X Server.\n- `bsd` - prints a message about how to update BSD systems to enable the chef-client service.\n- `systemd` - sets up the service under systemd. Supported on systemd based distros.\n\n### default\n\nIncludes the `chef-client::service` recipe by default on *nix platforms and the task recipe for Windows hosts.\n\n### delete_validation\n\nUse this recipe to delete the validation certificate (default `/etc/chef/validation.pem`) when using a `chef-client` after the client has been validated and authorized to connect to the server.\n\n### cron\n\nUse this recipe to run chef-client as a cron job rather than as a service. The cron job runs after random delay that is between 0 and 90 seconds to ensure that the chef-clients don't attempt to connect to the chef-server at the exact same time. You should set `node['chef_client']['init_style'] = 'none'` when you use this mode but it is not required.\n\n### task\n\nUse this recipe to run chef-client on Windows nodes as a scheduled task. Without modifying attributes the scheduled task will run 30 minutes after the recipe runs, with each chef run rescheduling the run 30 minutes in the future. By default the job runs as the system user. The time period between runs can be modified with the `default['chef_client']['task']['frequency_modifier']` attribute and the user can be changed with the `default['chef_client']['task']['user']` and `default['chef_client']['task']['password']` attributes.\n\n## Usage\n\nUse the recipes as described above to configure your systems to run Chef as a service via cron / scheduled task or one of the service management systems supported by the recipes.\n\nThe `chef-client::config` recipe is only _required_ with init style `init` (default setting for the attribute on debian/redhat family platforms, because the init script doesn't include the `pid_file` option which is set in the config.\n\nThe config recipe is used to dynamically generate the `/etc/chef/client.rb` config file. The template walks all attributes in `node['chef_client']['config']` and writes them out as key:value pairs. The key should be the configuration directive. For example, the following attributes (in a role):\n\n```ruby\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chef_client\" => {\n    \"config\" => {\n      \"ssl_verify_mode\" => \":verify_peer\",\n      \"client_fork\" => true\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nwill render the following configuration (`/etc/chef/client.rb`):\n\n```ruby\nchef_server_url \"https://api.chef.io/organizations/MYORG\"\nvalidation_client_name \"MYORG-validator\"\nssl_verify_mode :verify_peer\nnode_name \"config-ubuntu-1204\"\nclient_fork true\n```\n\nThe `chef_server_url`, `node_name` and `validation_client_name` are set by default in the attributes file from `Chef::Config`. They are presumed to come from the `knife bootstrap` command when setting up a new node for Chef. To set the node name to the default value (the `node['fqdn']` attribute), it can be set false. Be careful when setting this or the Server URL, as those values may already exist.\n\nAs another example, to set HTTP proxy configuration settings. By default Chef will not use a proxy.\n\n```ruby\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chef_client\" => {\n    \"config\" => {\n      \"http_proxy\" => \"http://proxy.mycorp.com:3128\",\n      \"https_proxy\" => \"http://proxy.mycorp.com:3128\",\n      \"http_proxy_user\" => \"my_username\",\n      \"http_proxy_pass\" => \"Awe_some_Pass_Word!\",\n      \"no_proxy\" => \"*.vmware.com,10.*\"\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\n### Configuration Includes\n\nThe `/etc/chef/client.rb` file will include all the configuration files in `/etc/chef/client.d/*.rb`. To create custom configuration, simply render a file resource with `file` (and the `content` parameter), `template`, `remote_file`, or `cookbook_file`. For example, in your own cookbook that requires custom Chef client configuration, create the following `cookbook_file` resource:\n\n```ruby\nchef_gem 'syslog-logger'\n\ncookbook_file \"/etc/chef/client.d/myconfig.rb\" do\n  source \"myconfig.rb\"\n  mode '0644'\n  notifies :create, \"ruby_block[reload_client_config]\"\nend\n\ninclude_recipe 'chef-client::config'\n```\n\nThen create `files/default/myconfig.rb` with the configuration content you want. For example, if you wish to create a configuration to log to syslog:\n\n```ruby\nrequire 'syslog-logger'\nrequire 'syslog'\n\nLogger::Syslog.class_eval do\n  attr_accessor :sync, :formatter\nend\n\nlog_location Logger::Syslog.new('chef-client', ::Syslog::LOG_DAEMON)\n```\n\nOr, if you're using Chef >= 12.4:\n\n```ruby\nlog_location Chef::Log::Syslog.new('chef-client', ::Syslog::LOG_DAEMON)\n```\n\nOn Windows, with Chef >= 12.4:\n```ruby\nlog_location Chef::Log::WinEvt.new\n```\n\n### Requiring Gems\n\nUse the `load_gems` attribute to install gems that need to be required in the client.rb. This attribute should be a hash. The gem will also be installed with `chef_gem`. For example, suppose we want to use a Chef Handler Gem, `chef-handler-updated-resources`, which is used in the next heading. Set the attributes, e.g., in a role:\n\n```ruby\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chef_client\" => {\n    \"load_gems\" => {\n      \"chef-handler-updated-resources\" => {\n        \"require_name\" => \"chef/handler/updated_resources\",\n        \"version\" => \"0.1\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nEach key in `load_gems` is the name of a gem. Each gem hash can have two keys, the `require_name` which is the string that will be `require`'d in `/etc/chef/client.rb`, and `version` which is the version of the gem to install. If the version is not specified, the latest version will be installed.\n\nThe above example will render the following in `/etc/chef/client.rb`:\n\n```ruby\n[\"chef/handler/updated_resources\"].each do |lib|\n  begin\n    require lib\n  rescue LoadError\n    Chef::Log.warn \"Failed to load #{lib}. This should be resolved after a chef run.\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Start, Report, Exception Handlers\n\nTo dynamically render configuration for Start, Report, or Exception handlers, set the following attributes in the `config` attributes:\n\n- `start_handlers`\n- `report_handlers`\n- `exception_handlers`\n\nThis is an alternative to using the [`chef_handler` cookbook](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/chef_handler).\n\nEach of these attributes must be an array of hashes. The hash has two keys, `class` (a string), and `arguments` (an array). For example, to use the report handler in the [Requiring Gems](#requiring-gems) section:\n\n```ruby\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chef_client\" => {\n    \"config\" => {\n      \"report_handlers\" => [\n        {\"class\" => \"SimpleReport::UpdatedResources\", \"arguments\" => []}\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n)\n```\n\nIf the handler you're using has an initialize method that takes arguments, then pass each one as a member of the array. Otherwise, leave it blank as above.\n\nThis will render the following in `/etc/chef/client.rb`.\n\n```ruby\nreport_handlers << SimpleReport::UpdatedResources.new()\n```\n\n### Alternate Init Styles\n\nThe alternate init styles available are:\n\n- runit\n- none -- should be specified if you are running chef-client as cron job\n\n#### Runit\n\nTo use runit, download the cookbook from Supermarket.\n\nChange the `init_style` to runit in the base role and add the runit recipe to the role's run list:\n\n```ruby\nname \"base\"\ndescription \"Base role applied to all nodes\"\ndefault_attributes(\n  \"chef_client\" => {\n    \"init_style\" => \"runit\"\n  }\n)\nrun_list(\n  \"recipe[chef-client::delete_validation]\",\n  \"recipe[runit]\",\n  \"recipe[chef-client]\"\n)\n```\n\nThe `chef-client` recipe will create the chef-client service configured with runit. The runit run script will be located in `/etc/sv/chef-client/run`. The output log will be in the runit service directory, `/etc/sv/chef-client/log/main/current`.\n\n#### Launchd\n\nOn Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server, the default service implementation is \"launchd\".\n\nSince launchd can run a service in interval mode, by default chef-client is not started in daemon mode like on Debian or Ubuntu. Keep this in mind when you look at your process list and check for a running chef process! If you wish to run chef-client in daemon mode, set attribute `chef_client.launchd_mode` to \"daemon\".\n\n## Installing and updating chef-client\n\nThis cookbook does not handle updating the chef-client, as that's out of the cookbook's current scope. To sensibly manage updates of the chef-client omnibus install, we refer you to:\n\n- [omnibus_updater](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/omnibus_updater) - Cookbook for installing the omnibus Chef package and keeping your install up-to-date\n\nFor more on why this cookbook does not support installs, see [Issue #102](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client/pull/102)\n\n## Resources\n\n### chef_client_scheduled_task\n\nThe chef_client_scheduled_task setups up chef-client to run as a scheduled task. This resource is what the task recipe calls under the hood. You can use this recipe directly when writing a wrapper cookbook. Additionally using this resource directly allows you to control where you store the user credentials instead of storing them as node attributes. This is useful if you want to store these credentials in an encrypted databag.\n\n### Actions\n\n- add\n- remove\n\n### Properties\n\n- `user` - The username to run the task as. default: 'System'\n- `password`, The password of the user to run the task as if not using the System user\n- `frequency` - Frequency with which to run the task (e.g., 'hourly', 'daily', etc.) Default is 'minute'\n- `frequency_modifier` Numeric value to go with the scheduled task frequency - default: '30'\n- `start_time` The start time for the task in HH:mm format. If the `frequency` is `minute` default start time will be `Time.now` plus the `frequency_modifier` number of minutes.\n- `splay` - A random number of seconds between 0 and X to add to interval. default: '300'\n- `config_directory` - The path to the Chef config directory. default: 'C:/chef'\n- `log_directory` - The path to the Chef log directory. default: 'CONFIG_DIRECTORY/log'\n- `chef_binary_path` - The path to the chef-client binary. default: 'C:/opscode/chef/bin/chef-client'\n- `daemon_options` - An optional array of extra options to pass to the chef-client\n\n## License & Authors\n\n**Author:** Cookbook Engineering Team ([cookbooks@chef.io](mailto:cookbooks@chef.io))\n\n**Copyright:** 2010-2017, Chef Software, Inc.\n\n```\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache-2.0","platforms":{"aix":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","fedora":">= 0.0.0","freebsd":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","mac_os_x":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","suse":">= 0.0.0","opensuse":">= 0.0.0","opensuseleap":">= 0.0.0","ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","windows":">= 0.0.0","zlinux":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"cron":">= 2.0.0","logrotate":">= 1.9.0","windows":">= 2.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{"chef-client":"Includes the service recipe by default.","chef-client::bsd_service":"Configures chef-client as a service on *BSD","chef-client::config":"Configures the client.rb from a template.","chef-client::cron":"Runs chef-client as a cron job rather than as a service","chef-client::delete_validation":"Deletes validation.pem after client registers","chef-client::init_service":"Configures chef-client as a SysVInit service","chef-client::launchd_service":"Configures chef-client as a launchd service on OS X","chef-client::runit_service":"Configures chef-client as a service under Runit","chef-client::service":"Sets up a client daemon to run periodically","chef-client::smf_service":"Configures chef-client as a service under SMF","chef-client::src_service":"Configures chef-client as a Service Resource Controller service on AIX","chef-client::task":"Runs chef-client as a Windows task.","chef-client::upstart_service":"Configures chef-client as a service under Upstart","chef-client::windows_service":"Configures chef-client as a service on Windows"},"source_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client","issues_url":"https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/chef-client/issues","chef_version":[[">= 12.11"]],"ohai_version":[]}
